Over the course of my programming career, I've gained experience with a wide range of languages. Recently, I've found a comfortable balance between JavaScript/TypeScript and C++/C, enabling me to work on projects ranging from fancy user interfaces to high-performance tools.

While many developers shy away from documentation, I find it holds a captivating charm. A meticulously documented codebase, to me, is like a well-written story. It reveals the hidden logic, the "how" and "why" behind the code's magic. I strive for clear, concise, and informative documentation, ensuring understanding blooms alongside functionality.

My documentation weapon of choice? Obsidian.md. But my creative spark doesn't stop there. I'm currently weaving a custom Obsidian theme â€“ part of my "Violet Void" series â€“ with a breathtaking combination of deep purples and subtle transparencies for a sleek, modern aesthetic. Let me tell you, it looks incredible (already using it myself!). This theme is on the horizon, ready to empower others to code in style.
